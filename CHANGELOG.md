## [1.0.0] - 2025-05-07

### Editor version and package compatibility

  * This version of the package requires minimal Unity Editor version `6000.1.0b12`. You can install the official **Unity 6.1** (e.g. `6000.1.0f1` or newer) from the Unity Hub.
  * Package dependencies updated in this version:
    * OpenXR Plugin (`com.unity.xr.openxr`) 1.14.2
    * AR Foundation (`com.unity.xr.arfoundation`) 6.1.0
  * Verified compatible packages:
    * Unity OpenXR Android XR (`com.unity.xr.androidxr-openxr`) 1.0.0-pre.2
    * Composition Layer (`com.unity.xr.compositionlayers`) 2.0.0

### Known issues
  * **Vulkan Subsampling** now causes rendering issues in multiple samples, including **ImageTracking**, **HandMesh**, **SceneMeshing**, and **XRController**.
    * It's confirmed as a regression issue from **OpenXR Plugin** package, expect to be fixed by future releases.
    * **Workaround**: To disable it, under the setting menu of **Android XR (Extensions) Session Management**, unselect **Subsampling (Vulkan)**.

### Added
  * Marker Tracking and QR Code Tracking:
    * New OpenXR Feature `XRMarkerTrackingFeature` which provides marker tracking via `ARTrackedImageManager`. Including APIs:
      * Extension method `ARTrackedImage.IsMarker()` to check if the image instance is a marker.
      * Extension method `ARTrackedImage.TryGetMarkerData(out XRMarkerDictionary, out int)` to get marker data from a marker instance.
      * New ScriptableObject `XRMarkerDatabase`, a container of `XRMarkerDatabaseEntry`, used to manage marker references in an `XRReferenceImageLibrary`.
    * New OpenXR Feature `XRQrCodeTrackingFeature` which provides QR Code tracking via `ARTrackedImageManager`. Including APIs:
      * Extension method `ARTrackedImage.IsQrCode()` to check if the image instance is a QR Code.
      * Extension method `ARTrackedImage.TryGetQrCodeData(out string)` to get the QR code data from a QR Code instance.
    * New implementation of `XRImageTrackingSubsystem`. To use it with AR Foundation's `ARTrackedImageManager`, create an `XRReferenceImageLibrary` with a QR Code reference named **QrCode** and/or updates marker references from `XRMarkerDatabase`.
    * New sample **ImageTracking** which demonstrates the usage of QR Code tracking and marker tracking.
  * Added experimental features support which use OpenXR extensions `XR_ANDROIDX_*`. **Noted**:
    * Applications can then access `ANDROIDX` extensions at runtime but **cannot be published in Google Play Store**.
    * Experimental features can take several iterations towards formal releases which **may include breaking changes, deprecation, and removal**.
  * Body Tracking **(Experimental*)**:
    * New Experimental OpenXR Feature `XRBodyTrackingFeature` which provides body tracking via `ARHumanBodyManager`.
    * New sample **BodyTracking** which demonstrates the usage of body tracking.
  * System State **(Experimental*)**:
    * New Experimental OpenXR Feature `XRSystemStateFeature` which provides system state via `TryGetSystemState(out systemState)`.
    * Added system state API usage to **BlendMode** sample.
  * Scene Meshing **(Experimental*)**:
    * New Experimental OpenXR Feature `XRSceneMeshingFeature` which provides scene mesh data via `XRMeshSubsystem`.
    * Added new sample **SceneMeshing** which demonstrates the usage of scene meshing API.

### Changed
  * **Subsampling (Vulkan)** is now disabled by default in **Android XR (Extensions) Session Management**.
  * Face Tracking:
    * Updated `XRFaceParameterIndices` with new enum values for tongue blendshapes.
    * Updated `XRFaceState` with new property `ConfidenceRegions`, indexed by new enum `XRFaceConfidenceRegion`.

### Deprecated
  * N/A

### Removed
  * Removed `XRTrackableFeature`, `XRAnchorFeature`, and **Trackables** sample. Please use `ARPlaneFeature` and `ARAnchorFeature` from **Unity OpenXR Android XR** instead.
  * Removed `XRDisplayRefreshRateFeature` and **DisplayRefreshRate** sample. Please use `DisplayUtilitiesFeature` from **Unity OpenXR Android XR** instead.

### Fixed
  * Fixed typo in `XRHandMeshFeature` which referred to depth texture permission rather than hand tracking permission.
  * Fixed bug in `XRHandMeshFeature` which started a subsystem in the `OnSubsystemStop()` callback.

## [0.9.1] - 2025-04-03

### Added
  * New Sample **XRController** which syncs and displays Samsung Controller.
